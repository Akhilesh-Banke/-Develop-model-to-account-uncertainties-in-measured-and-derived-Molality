# -Develop-model-to-account-uncertainties-in-Molality
📌 Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of uncertainty in molality—an essential physicochemical property—by combining error propagation analysis, statistical modeling, and a Python-based GUI application. It streamlines experimental workflows by reducing the need for extensive trials while ensuring high accuracy and reproducibility.

🎯 Key Features
Uncertainty Quantification: Applied error propagation techniques to evaluate uncertainty in measured and derived values.

Statistical Modeling: Built a high-accuracy polynomial regression model (R² = 0.99) to predict molality uncertainty, minimizing experimental overhead.

Data Validation Techniques: Tackled heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation using data transformations and the Cochrane–Orcutt method for robust model performance.

GUI Automation: Developed an intuitive desktop application with Tkinter to automate complex calculations and provide fast, accurate results.

Practical Utility: Designed for real-world lab environments, improving efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility of experimental processes.
